# real-estate-price-prediction: Data Modelling

This part of the project involves the cleaning, sorting, and modelling of the data from the Data Analysis section

Best models were randomforest and XGBoost, with the dataset I had.  I obtained an result of 0.7 for the R^2 correlation.  Also, a Mean Aboslulte Error around 1200000 euros.  With a larger dataset a better correlation as well as MAE would certainly be attainable.  

I used the randomforest regressor model in the deployment of the API
